How to create your own neural network based on randomized data

1. Download "Uncompressed" folder
2. Place Parsedata.py in the same directory as the Uncompressed folder 
	i.e. \MAIN_DIRECTORY\
		  \Uncompressed\
		  	\4
			   etc.
			\6	
			   etc.
		  \Parsedata.py
		  \ModelTesting.py
3. Run DataPrep.py
4. Run MLModel_Layer_1.py
5. Run MLModel_Layer_2_Hops.py
6. Run MLModel_Layer_2_Jumps.py
7. Run MLModel_Testing.py (This will take a while, get a cup of coffee)

**Note - 	There are already preprocessed models in the "Models" folder.
		If these are all you need, take them and ignore steps 1-7.
