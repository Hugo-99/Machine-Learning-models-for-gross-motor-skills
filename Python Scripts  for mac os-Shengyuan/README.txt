How to use ParseData.py and ModelTesting.py

1. Download "Uncompressed" folder
2. Place Parsedata.py and ModelTesting.py in the same folder with the Uncompressed folder 
	i.e. \MAIN_DIRECTORY\
		  \Uncompressed\
		  	\4
			   etc.
			\6	
			   etc.
		  \Parsedata.py
		  \ModelTesting.py
3. Place "Current Model" folder in same subdirectory
4. Run Parsedata.py (This will take a while, get a cup of coffee)
5. Run ModelTesting.py (This will take significantly less time)
