Notes -
Model has a 'long' compilation time of approximately 4+ minutes.
Nadam optimizer seems to work best with the current model information.
Accuracy is improved when frames are contexted with each frame 
in the motion as a whole.
Single layers resulted in accuracies of approximately 97.3% when tested in training data.
Use of Doubled layers has halved the number of inaccurate motion guesses.
relu activation proves best for this task.

Testing data will need to be acquired as quickly as possible to ensure the model is not
currently normalized to the training dataset.

Accuracy with Testing Data :
	TBD
